# Citi BikeShare Analysis
Using a data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company start-up in Des Moines, IA. This is accomplished by importing, styling, and portraying data accurately, and ultimately creating worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset to present to a group of investors.

## Overview of the Analysis

After returning from an amazing trip to New York City, Kate thinks it might be a good idea to explore a bike share project for her home town of Des Moines, IA.  She enjoyed using the Citi BikeShare while on her vacation to explore New York City and thinks there is a potential business case for Des Moines.  She asks for my assistance to prepare a presentation for a potential angel investor for this venture.

Kate suggests that I use publically available Citi Bike data in preparing the presentation.  Tableau Public will be used to create the data visualizations for the business proposal pitch to the investor group.  Caution must be exercised with this project because Des Moines is no New York City!  The data selected for this presentation was from August 2019.  It is believed that Citi Bike traffic and usage would be heaviest during the summer season.

It will take a combination of my data expertise and critical thinking skills and Kate's salesmanship to convince this investor group that this is a viable business proposal.
